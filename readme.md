# Evil webserver
this is a simple webserver to I can use to create endpoints for CTFs and bug bounties. 

# How to use
You need to have node installed on your PC. If you do, it's as simple as running node server.js

I advice installing nodemon. If you have nodemon install run nodemon server.js to start the webserver
